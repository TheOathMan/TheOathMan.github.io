                <p>The Moon is a mobile application that renders the moon realistically, including its phases, liberations, and apogee/perigee in real-time and at any time instance.

                <h2>4. Location Data</h2>
                <p>The App may optionally request access to your device's location (longitude and latitude) to provide an accurate rendering of the moon based on your location.

                <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data and ensure it is not accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. However, please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
