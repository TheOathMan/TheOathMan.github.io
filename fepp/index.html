                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <h5>last update, Aug 12, 2022</h5>
                <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div> -->
                <p>Flat Earth is an application that was built fundamentally to provide a simple, easy to use tool to
                    display day night cycle, moon phases, sun and moon current overhead locations and more (refer to the
                    store listing). The application was not built for the purpose of proving or disproving geocentrism,
                    but rather intended to be a simple useful tool for everyone. I used a unique composite flat map
                    based on the azimuthal projection.</p>

                <P>OProjects built the Flat Earth app as an Ad free app. This SERVICE is provided by OProjects at no
                    cost and is intended for use as is. This doesn't include the pro version of the app. This page is
                    used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                    Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</P>

                <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                    to this policy. The Personal Information that's being collected at runtime by the application, is
                    needed for providing and improving the Service within the app itself, and then will be discarded
                    once the application is closed. This app does not collect, or share your information with anyone.
                    The app will create a local save file to store all the settings including the longitude and latitude
                    of your location for better performance. This file will not be shared with anyone and will be
                    removed once the app is uninstalled</p>

                <!-- <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Flat Earth App unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p> -->

                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

                <p>For a better experience, while using the app, the you will be prompt to provide it with certain
                    personally identifiable information, including but not limited to GPS location to enhance compass
                    functionality . The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected
                    by me in any way.</p>
                <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

                <h2>Service Providers</h2>
                <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate our Service.</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on my behalf.</li>
                    <li>To perform Service-related services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>I value your trust in providing the app with Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the
                    internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>
